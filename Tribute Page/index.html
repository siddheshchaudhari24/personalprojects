                            Srinivasa Ramanujan is one of the most influential mathematicians of all time. His contributions to mathematics have had a lasting impact on the field, and he remains a revered figure in the mathematics community. But who was Srinivasa Ramanujan?</p>
                            <p>Who Was Srinivasa Ramanujan?</p> 
                        <p>
                            Srinivasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician who was born in 1887 in India and died in 1920 at the age of 32. Ramanujan's work on mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions is widely regarded as some of the most impressive work in the field. He also made substantial contributions to the theory of partitions, which is a branch of number theory that deals with the ways that numbers can be divided into smaller parts. Ramanujan's work has been influential in many different areas of mathematics, and he is considered one of the most brilliant mathematicians of all time.
